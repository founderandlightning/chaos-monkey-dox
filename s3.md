# Setting up S3 Buckets
For media and backups storage, we leverage Amazon S3. The process involves the creation of three IAM users corresponding to staging, production, and backup, and utilizing these users for accessing the respective buckets.

1. Create three users for staging, production, and backup. A recommended naming convention is, for example, staging-bucket-name-user and bkp-bucket-name-user.
2. Generate access keys for these users and securely store them.
3. Establish three buckets using a suggested naming convention such as staging-bucket-name and bkp-bucket-name.
4. Implement bucket policies as per the example given [here]((https://gist.github.com/jdecode/23a42aaa8fb01feb03f73164c15dc557?permalink_comment_id=3415719#gistcomment-3415719)) to restrict access to each user and configure [CORS](https://gist.github.com/jdecode/23a42aaa8fb01feb03f73164c15dc557?permalink_comment_id=4457063#gistcomment-4457063) rules.
5. Create user's access [policy](https://gist.github.com/jdecode/23a42aaa8fb01feb03f73164c15dc557?permalink_comment_id=3415718#gistcomment-3415718) rules.
6. Formulate access [policies](https://gist.github.com/jdecode/23a42aaa8fb01feb03f73164c15dc557?permalink_comment_id=3415718#gistcomment-3415718) for each user.
7. Set the values for `FILESYSTEM_DISK` and `TEMP_FILESYSTEM_DISK` to `S3`, along with other necessary environment variables for the bucket in Heroku (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, `AWS_BUCKET`).
